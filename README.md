# ABAP Platform Examples for Analytical Data Modeling
The ABAP Platform Examples for Analytical Data Modeling provide an analytical data model that is based on the ABAP Flight Reference Scenario. It allows to get  familiar with modern, ABAP-CDS based analytical data modeling and provides examples for the most prominent features of the Embedded Analytics functionality in the ABAP Platform.
## Usage
You can either use the provided data model as is as a kind of feature showcase app. In this case, you may want to check out the [wiki that documents the provided analytical queries](https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-platform-analytics-data-modeling/wiki) and how they relate to the analytics features.
Furthermore, you can build your own data model using parts of the examples. Most of them are C1 released to be used as data sources in ABAP Cloud development.

## Requirements
Make sure to fulfill the following prerequisites:
* You have access to a recent ABAP Platform Cloud instance ([at least 2111](https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blogs-by-sap/cds-analytical-projection-views-the-new-analytical-query-model/ba-p/13522701)).
* You have downloaded and installed the most recent version of ABAP Development Tools (ADT). See the [installation page](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#abap). 
* You have created an ABAP Cloud Project in ADT that allows you to access your ABAP Environment instance.
* You have installed the [abapGit](https://github.com/abapGit/eclipse.abapgit.org) plug-in for ADT from the [ABAPGit update site](http://eclipse.abapgit.org/updatesite/).
* You have used abapGit to import the [ABAP Flight Reference Scenario](https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-platform-refscen-flight) for ABAP Platform Cloud as described in the resrective [README](https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-platform-refscen-flight/blob/ABAP-platform-cloud/README.md).

## Download and Configuration
### Download
Use the abapGit plug-in to import the <em>ABAP Platform Examples for Analytical Data Modeling</em> by executing the following steps:
1. In your ABAP cloud project, create the ABAP package `ZNER_ANA_FLIGHT` (using the superpackage `ZNER_SAP`) as the target package for the demo content to be downloaded (leave the suggested values unchanged when following the steps in the package creation wizard).
2. To add the <em>abapGit Repositories</em> view to the <em>ABAP</em> perspective, click `Window` > `Show View` > `Other...` from the menu bar and choose `abapGit Repositories`.
3. In the <em>abapGit Repositories</em> view, click the `+` icon to clone an abapGit repository.
4. Enter the following URL of this repository: `https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-platform-analytics-data-modeling.git` and choose <em>Next</em>.
5. Enter the newly created package `ZNER_ANA_FLIGHT` as the target package and choose <em>Next</em>.
6. Create a new transport request that you only use for this demo content installation (recommendation) and choose <em>Finish</em> to link the Git repository to your ABAP cloud project. The repository appears in the abapGit Repositories View with status <em>Linked</em>.
7. Right-click on the new ABAP repository and choose `pull` to start the cloning of the repository contents. Note that this procedure may take a few minutes. 
8. Once the cloning has finished, the status is set to `Pulled Successfully`. (Refresh the `abapGit Repositories` view to see the progress of the import).
9. Refresh the project tree.

As a result of the installation procedure above, the ABAP system creates an inactive version of all artifacts of the demo content and adds the sub package `ZNER_ANA_FLIGHT_QUERY` to the target package that contains additional analytical queries that demonstrate various features of embedded analytics.

NOTE: The namespace ZNER_ is reserved for the demo content. Apart from the downloaded demo content, do not use the namespace ZNER_ and do not create any development objects in the downloaded packages. You can access the development objects in ZNER_ from your own namespace.

### Activation
To activate all development objects from the `ZNER_ANA_FLIGHT` package: 
1. Click the mass-activation icon (<em>Activate Inactive ABAP Development Objects</em>) in the toolbar.  
2. In the dialog that appears, select all development objects in the transport request (that you created for the demo content installation) and choose `Activate`. (The activation may take a few minutes.)

### Data Generation
To fill the demo database tables: 
1. Expand the package structure in the Project Explorer `ZNER_FLIGHT_LEGACY` > `Source Code Library` > `Classes`.
2. Open the data generator class `ZNER_CL_FLIGHT_DATA_GENERATOR` and go to `lcl_flight_data_generator`.
3. Find the METHOD `build_connection_recurrency` and change the variable `lv_days_between` to use the constant `cv_days_between_4weeks`. This will make sure the generated data better suits the analytical examples.<br>
The resulting code should now look like this: `DATA(lv_days_between) = cv_days_between_4weeks.`
6. Mass-activate.
7. Now press `F9` to run the generator as Console Application.

NOTE: Even if you did run the generator before, you need to run the generator again after having installed the <em>ABAP Platform Examples for Analytical Data Modeling</em> to get additional analytics-specific example data e.g. for hierarchies.

NOTE: The data generator will always generate "current" data around the date it was trigered. The demo views instead may have fixed dates e.g. for parameter defaults or in filter conditions. Therefore please check and adapt these dates in case you experience issues when previewing data.

### Optional: Importing Currency Conversion Rates
To be able to use the currency conversion feature, you need the currency conversion rates to be available in your system. If loading currency conversion rates is not set up in your system, you may use the following procedure for lading the rates one time (or on demand):
1. Create a new package of your choice, e.g. `ZCURR_CONV`.
2. Import the Github repo `https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-abap-exchange-rates` into the new package.
3. Mass-activate.
4. Check the [README.md](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-abap-exchange-rates/blob/main/README.md) of the repo for instructions how to use.
5. Try the XML import from the European Central Bank by running `zcl_ecb_exchange_rates_xml` as console application (`F9`).
7. As an alternative implement class `zcl_ecb_exchange_rates_xml` and run it in the console.

NOTE: Some queries do have fixed dates for the currency conversion in the demo content. You may need to update the dates in order to match the available conversion rates in your system by adapting the `exchange_rate_date` parameter value in the `currency_conversion` function of the query.

## Test the ABAP Platform Examples
1. Make sure all development objects are fully activated.
2. Open `ZNER_ANA_C_AirportCapaQry` in ADT.
3. Right-click `ZNER_ANA_C_AirportCapaQry` and choose `Open With` -> `Data Preview`.
4. A browser window should open that displays a multi-dimensional dat preview of the analytical query.
